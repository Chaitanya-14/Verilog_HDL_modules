# Verilog HDL Practice Modules

This repository contains Verilog HDL modules that I have been practicing from the beginning. It includes basic gates, combinational circuits, and their respective testbenches and simulation files.

## Contents

### 1. Basic Gates
This folder contains implementations and testbenches for basic logic gates:
- **AND Gate**: [1.AND_gate](Basic_gates/1.AND_gate/)
- **OR Gate**: [2.OR_gate](Basic_gates/2.OR_gate/)
- **NOT Gate**: [3.NOT_gate](Basic_gates/3.NOT_gate/)
- **NOR Gate**: [4.NOR_gate](Basic_gates/4.NOR_gate/)
- **NAND Gate**: [5.NAND_gate](Basic_gates/5.NAND_gate/)
- **XOR Gate**: [6.XOR_gate](Basic_gates/6.XOR_gate/)
- **XNOR Gate**: [7.XNOR_gate](Basic_gates/7.XNOR_gate/)

### 2. Combinational Circuits
This folder contains implementations and testbenches for combinational circuits:
- **Half Adder**: [1.HalfAdder](Combinational_Circuits/1.HalfAdder/)
- **Full Adder**: [2.FullAdder](Combinational_Circuits/2.FullAdder/)

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the respective folder for the module you want to explore.
2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` or `to_cmpile_run.txt` files for compilation and simulation.
3. Use GTKWave to visualize the waveforms from the `.vcd` files.
